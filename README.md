## Todos and thoughts:

- write an alarmer through telegram or whatever
- make it interval
- you have to create same piece of code for different urls
- how to solve a problem where the websites are different and you have to write different code piece for each website, maybe get all the hrefs from website and check ?
- maybe a json field would be better
- currently it will ring if the first one is changed, so if they add 2 or more, you dont know. you just know there is new activity happening
